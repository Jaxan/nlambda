Installation guide:
- Download and unpack the package file (http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~szynwelski/nlambda/nlambda-1.0.tar.gz).
- Move into the directory nlambda-1.0.
- Perform the following commands:
    runhaskell Setup configure --user -fTOTAL_ORDER
    runhaskell Setup build
    runhaskell Setup install
- The flag TOTAL_ORDER is required to install package with ordered atoms (otherwise equality atoms will be used).
- To install the package globally (not only for the user account) skip user parameter (https://wiki.haskell.org/Cabal/How_to_install_a_Cabal_package).
- Additionally, you should install the Z3 Theorem Prover (https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) and add it to the PATH environment variable (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)).
